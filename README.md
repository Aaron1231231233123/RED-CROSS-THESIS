## 🎯 **Objectives**  

### 🏆 **General Objective**  
To develop an **integrated Blood Donation and Inventory Management System** for the **Philippine Red Cross (PRC)** that optimizes blood supply, enhances donor engagement, and streamlines hospital request processing.  

### 🔍 **Specific Objectives**  

1. **📊 Real-Time Blood Inventory Management**  
   - Implement a system that tracks blood stock levels in real time.  
   - Integrate **time series forecasting** to predict future blood demand.  
   - Enable **event-based demand prediction** for blood needs during festivals and emergencies.  

2. **🏥 Hospital Blood Request System**  
   - Develop a feature that enables hospitals to **request blood units directly** from the PRC.  
   - Automate request responses, indicating **full or partial fulfillment**.  

3. **📱 Mobile Application for Donors**  
   - Provide donors with tracking features for their **blood donation status** (testing, storage, dispensed, etc.).  
   - Implement a **countdown** for the next eligible donation and push notifications for reminders.  
   - Offer **health tips** and **donation history** to encourage donor retention.  

4. **📊 System Analytics and Reporting**  
   - Generate **analytics on blood supply trends, donor activity, and hospital requests**.  
   - Integrate **event-based blood demand forecasting** (e.g., **Dinagyang, elections, fiestas**).  
   - Implement **real-time dashboard visualization** for PRC administrators.  

5. **🔍 System Evaluation & ISO Compliance**  
   - Implement **ISO 9001 (Quality Management)** to ensure efficiency, reliability, and usability.  
   - Apply **ISO 27001 (Information Security)** to protect donor and patient data.  
   - Use **AES-256 encryption** for sensitive data and enforce **role-based access**.  
   - Conduct **system performance monitoring**, usability testing, and security audits.  
   - Implement **continuous improvement (PDCA cycle)** for quality enhancement.  
   - Set up **a cybersecurity incident response plan** to handle potential threats.  

6. **🛡️ Security and Data Privacy**  
   - Implement **secure user authentication** for donors, hospitals, and administrators.  
   - Ensure **data encryption** for sensitive information and compliance with **Data Privacy Laws**.  

7. **🌍 Web and Mobile Integration**  
   - Develop a **web dashboard** for administrators to monitor and manage inventory.  
   - Build a **cross-platform mobile app** using **Flutter/React Native** for donor engagement.  

🚀 **_This system aims to enhance the efficiency of blood distribution, improve donor retention, and ensure timely blood availability for medical emergencies._**
