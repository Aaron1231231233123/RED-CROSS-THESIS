Project Overview
This research aims to systemize and digitize the Red Cross inventory system by integrating data-driven analysis and a user-friendly interface. The system will enhance blood inventory management, streamline operations, and introduce predictive analytics to anticipate demand spikes.

Key Features:
Digital Inventory Management: Transitioning from manual to automated tracking of blood stocks.
Time Series Analysis: Predicting blood demand based on historical trends and upcoming events (e.g., Dinagyang, elections, fiestas in Iloilo).
Mobile Application for Donors: Allowing blood donors to track their donations, similar to parcel tracking in e-commerce platforms.
Current Development:
Implementing time series forecasting for demand prediction.
Designing a mobile application for donor transparency and engagement.
Developing a web-based system for Red Cross administrators to manage inventory efficiently.
Future Enhancements:
Real-time notifications for low stock alerts.
Integration with local event databases to refine demand predictions.
A feature for donors to receive updates on their blood donations.
