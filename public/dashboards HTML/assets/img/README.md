## "Throughout heaven and earth, I alone am the honored one."

Gojo Satoru, the enigmatic powerhouse of **Jujutsu Kaisen**, isn't just any sorcerer—he's a walking **domain expansion** of charisma and raw power. With his **Limitless** technique and **Six Eyes**, Gojo reigns as the strongest jujutsu sorcerer alive. 💥

## 🔥 Why is Gojo the GOAT?

- **Limitless Cursed Technique** 🌀 – Manipulates space at will.
- **Six Eyes** 👀 – Enhances perception to godly levels.
- **Infinity** ❌ – Nothing can touch him unless he allows it.
- **Hollow Purple** ☄️ – A technique so OP, it erases everything in its path.
- **Immaculate Drip** 😎 – The blindfold, the shades, the confidence—unmatched.
